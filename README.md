# MPPI GPU IMPLEMENTATION

## TODO:
  - [ ] verify device execution.
  - [ ] time comparaison with serial code.
  - [ ] plot trajectories to see their validity.
  - [ ] add randomness to the threads.
  - [ ] create cost class (get insp from the python class).
  - [ ] add cost.
  - [ ] finish algo as mentioned in the point_mass.cu example.
  - [ ] generalize the code.
  - [ ] try mujoco simulation.
  - [ ] start UUV integration (add for ros expert help).
  - [ ] write AUV math model.
  - [ ] start NN or GP integration.
